# üçÉ LABKENCE

We present Labkence, a disruptive platform that utilizes NASA‚Äôs satellite data at the service of smallholder farmers, specially in Chile. This way, Labkence will empower them to take critical water-related decisions informed with real data. Our platform not only delivers key metrics to farmers but also translates this data into simple, manageable insights tailored to general information about the farmer's land and resources.
